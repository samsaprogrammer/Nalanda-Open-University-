# Future Scope of Project
The system is flexible enough to ensure well-coordinated efforts to face the strategic challenges emerging from rapidly changing economic environment and global trends. Facilities have been incorporated in the software so that online processing can be done easily and thus the effort and time can be saved. 
- 	In future it is planned to develop our own web server to host the web application. 
-	Building Android Application for the system is also one of the future scopes of this project.
